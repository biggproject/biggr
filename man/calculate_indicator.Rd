\item{consumptionColumn}{<string> defining the energy consumption column name in data.}

\item{baselineConsumptionColumn}{<string> defining the counterfactual energy consumption column name in data.}

\item{energyPriceColumn}{<string> defining the column in data related with the price of energy consumption.}

\item{carbonEmissionsColumn}{<string> defining the column in data related with the CO2 emissions factor of energy consumption.}

\item{buildingGrossFloorArea}{<float> defining the gross floor area of the building.}

\item{heatingDegreeDays18Column}{<string> defining the column in data related with HDD with 18ยบ as base temperature.}

}
\value{
<data.frame> with a column 'ind' specifying the indicator time series and an optional 'weights' column specifying 
the weights that should be considered when time-aggregate the results.
}
\description{
This function calculates a large list of energy-related KPIs considering a set predicted and real energy measurements.
It only accounts for KPI that can be time-aggregable, so input and output data are time series.
