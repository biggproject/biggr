\arguments{
\item{data}{<data.frame> that contains all resultant time series.}

\item{indicators}{<array> of strings defining the KPIs to calculate. Possible values: 
EnergyUse, EnergyUseIntensity, EnergyUseSavings, EnergyUseSavingsRelative, 
EnergyUseSavingsIntensity, EnergyCost, EnergyCostIntensity, EnergyCostSavings, 
EnergyCostSavingsRelative, EnergyCostSavingsIntensity, EnergyEmissions, 
EnergyEmissionsIntensity, EnergyEmissionsSavings, EnergyEmissionsSavingsRelative,

\item{measuredProperty}{<uri> defining the energy consumption measured property. 
(E.g.: http://bigg-project.eu/ontology#EnergyConsumptionGridElectricity)}

\item{measuredPropertyComponent}{<uri> defining the energy consumption component name. 
(E.g.: "http://bigg-project.eu/ontology#Heating").}

\item{frequencies}{<array> of strings defining the frequencies used to resample the results. 
They must follow ISO 8601 format representing the time step. Examples: 'P1D' (One day), 
'P1Y' (One year), 'P1M' (One month), 'P1DT12H' (One day and a half)...}

\item{buildingId}{<string> building unique identifier.}

\item{buildingSubject}{<uri> building unique URI.}

\item{timeColumn}{<string> of the time column name.}

\item{localTimeZone}{<string> specifying the local time zone related to
the building in analysis. The format of this time zones are defined by
the IANA Time Zone Database (https://www.iana.org/time-zones).}

\item{consumptionColumn}{<string> defining the energy consumption column name in data.}

\item{indicatorsUnitsSubjects}{named <array> of URIs containing the units for each indicator.}

\item{baselineConsumptionColumn}{<string> defining the counterfactual energy consumption 
column name in data. By default it is not considered.}

\item{buildingGrossFloorArea}{<float> defining the gross floor area of the building. 
By default it is not considered.}

\item{outdoorTemperatureColumn}{<string> defining the column in data related to outdoor 
temperature. By default it is not considered.}

\item{heatingDegreeDays18Column}{<string> defining the column in data related with HDD 
with 18ยบ as base temperature. By default it is not considered.}

\item{coolingDegreeDays21Column}{<string> defining the column in data related with CDD 
with 21ยบ as base temperature. By default it is not considered.}

\item{carbonEmissionsColumn}{<string> defining the column in data related with the CO2 
emissions factor of energy consumption. By default it is not considered.}

\item{energyPriceColumn}{<string> defining the column in data related with the price of 
energy consumption. By default it is not considered.}

\item{modelName}{<string> Name of the model used to predict the consumption. By default 
results are not based by any model.}

\item{modelId}{<string> Identifier of the model used to predict the consumption. By default 
results are not based by any model.}

\item{modelLocation}{<string> containing the model path in the model storage infrastructure. 
By default results are not based by any model.}

\item{modelStorageInfrastructureSubject}{<uri> of the model infrastructure type. By default 
results are not based by any model.}

\item{modelTypeSubject}{<uri> of the model type depending on the data training strategy 
(Dynamic or Baseline). By default results are not based by any model.}

\item{modelBaselineYear}{<array> of integers containing the baseline years considered 
in model training. Only useful when the model type is baseline. By default results are 
not based by any model.}

\item{estimateWhenAggregate}{<boolean> defining if a linear estimation should be made 
when gaps are found in the time-aggregation of the results. By default, the estimation is done.}

\item{prevResults}{<list> with the previous results of this function. By default, no 
previous results are considered.}

\value{
<list> containing a knowledge graph with all resultant metadata and time series 
objects, that later can be transformed to TTL and JSON files.

\description{
Generate the results in harmonised format to BIGG ontology for the energy consumption benchmarking of 
buildings. In this case, the focus is to generate the results for the longitudinal benchmarking, 
so input data must be related with one single building.
