\arguments{
\item{data}{<data.frame> that contains all resultant time series.}

\item{indicators}{<array> of strings defining the KPIs to calculate. Possible values: 
EnergyUseSavings, EnergyUseSavingsRelative, EnergyUseSavingsIntensity, 
EnergyCostSavings, EnergyCostSavingsRelative, EnergyCostSavingsIntensity, 
EnergyEmissionsSavings, EnergyEmissionsSavingsRelative, EnergyEmissionsSavingsIntensity.}

\item{indicatorsNotAggregableByTime}{<string> defining the KPI to calculate. 
Possible values: NormalisedInvestmentCost, AvoidanceCost, SimplePayback, NetPresentValue, 
ProfitabilityIndex, NetPresentValueQuotient, InternalRateOfReturn.}

\item{measuredProperty}{<uri> defining the energy consumption measured property. 
(E.g.: http://bigg-project.eu/ontology#EnergyConsumptionGridElectricity)}

\item{measuredPropertyComponent}{<uri> defining the energy consumption component name. 
(E.g.: "http://bigg-project.eu/ontology#Heating").}

\item{frequencies}{<array> of strings defining the frequencies used to resample the results. 
They must follow ISO 8601 format representing the time step. 
Examples: 'P1D' (One day), 'P1Y' (One year), 'P1M' (One month), 'P1DT12H' (One day and a half)...}

\item{buildingId}{<string> building unique identifier.}

\item{buildingSubject}{<uri> building unique URI.}

\item{timeColumn}{<string> of the time column name.}

\item{localTimeZone}{<string> specifying the local time zone related to
the building in analysis. The format of this time zones are defined by
the IANA Time Zone Database (https://www.iana.org/time-zones).}

\item{eemProjectDf}{<data.frame> defining the single EEMs applied to the project. 
Columns that must be available: eemSubject, ExchangeRate, Investment, Date, Currency, 
Type, AffectationShare, buildingSubject, buildingElement, Lifespan, DiscountRate, eemProjectId}

\item{consumptionColumn}{<string> defining the energy consumption column name in data.}

\item{indicatorsTimeAggregationFunctions}{named <array> of the aggregation function used 
for each indicator. Possible values are: "SUM", "AVG", "WEIGHTED-AVG".}

\item{indicatorsUnitsSubjects}{named <array> of URIs containing the units for each indicator.}

\item{baselineConsumptionColumn}{<string> defining the counterfactual energy consumption column 
name in data. By default it is not considered.}

\item{buildingGrossFloorArea}{<float> defining the gross floor area of the building. By default 
it is not considered.}

\item{carbonEmissionsColumn}{<string> defining the column in data related with the CO2 emissions 
factor of energy consumption. By default it is not considered.}

\item{energyPriceColumn}{<string> defining the column in data related with the price of energy 
consumption. By default it is not considered.}

\item{modelName}{<string> Name of the model used to predict the consumption. By default results 
are not based by any model.}

\item{modelId}{<string> Identifier of the model used to predict the consumption. By default 
results are not based by any model.}

\item{modelLocation}{<string> containing the model path in the model storage infrastructure. 
By default results are not based by any model.}

\item{modelStorageInfrastructureSubject}{<uri> of the model infrastructure type. 
By default results are not based by any model.}

\item{estimateWhenAggregate}{<boolean> defining if a linear estimation should be made when 
gaps are found in the time-aggregation of the results. By default, the estimation is done.}

\item{prevResults}{<list> with the previous results of this function. By default, no previous 
results are considered.}
}
\value{
<list> containing a knowledge graph with all resultant metadata and time series 
objects, that later can be transformed to TTL and JSON files.

\description{
Generate the results in harmonised format to BIGG ontology for the EEM assessment in buildings. 
Results are always related to project of EEMs, which are single or combinations of multiple EEMs.
